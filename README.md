# Portfolio

## Description
A small React application built with the purpose of showcasing some of the projects that I have built over the course of the University of Arizona Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. The project contains links to some of my favorite respositories and their deployed counterparts, as well as information about myself and links to my LinkedIn, GitHub profile, and resume.
